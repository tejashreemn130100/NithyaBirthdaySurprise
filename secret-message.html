    <h1>A Letter for My Best Friend</h1>
    <p>
      Dear Nithya, <br><br>
      From the first day we met, I knew we would share an unbreakable bond. You have always been by my side, and on this special day, I want you to know how much you mean to me. Your laughter, kindness, and the way you light up a room are just some of the things that make you so amazing. <br><br>
      Thank you for being my constant support, my joy, and my forever friend. Here's to more memories, more laughter, and a lifetime of friendship. <br><br>
      Love you always, <br>
      Anitha
